# Disclaimer

In the [problem description](https://github.com/goeuro/challenges/blob/master/bus_route_challenge/README.md) it is stated, that input values fit into 32 bit integer, but it is not specified, whether values are 32bit signed or unsigned integers. In the current implementation assumption is, that values are 32bit signed integers.
